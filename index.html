    <center><ol><strong><u>Welcome To My Website</u></strong><br>This Website will serve as a guide for you to build your very own PC.
        Currently most people would rather buy a pre-built system but building your own also has many benefits.
        Building your own computer lets you have total control over the parts that go into it making it easier to optimize it for your use.
        Also when you know how to build one, this can make it easier to replace parts later on allowing your computer to be used for longer.
        The best part about building your own PC is that it is easier than you would think.

    <center><strong><u>Reasons To Build Your Own Computer</u></strong></center>
        <li><strong>It is more affordable</strong></li>
            <p>When buying a pre-built system manufacturers often drive up prices to make up for labour and to make a profit.
            When making your own, you can ensure that you get the best price.</p>
        <li><strong>It allows for you to upgrade easier in the future</strong></li>
            <p>When building your own computer your own computer you know where every part fits which makes it easy to simply replace it with a new one in the future.</p>
        <li><strong>You Can Customize it towards what you need</strong></li>
            <p>For example if you are a video editor that requires lots of storage, you can do that.
            you can have free reign over what parts go into your computer and that allows you to shape it to your needs best.</p>
